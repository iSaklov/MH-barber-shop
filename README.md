## About

This project represents one of my early freelance endeavors, and I'm proud to have taken it from concept to design, development, and deployment all by myself. It's not just a website; it's a testament to my journey and growth as a web developer and amateur designer üë®‚Äçüé®.

Not being a professional photographer, I had to tinker a lot when taking pictures and retouching photos üëπ. Additionally, despite not being a designer, I eagerly immersed myself in the world of design, learning the intricacies of tools like Figma.

M.H. - Barber Shop is a testament to my dedication to continuous learning and improvement. It's a showcase of my evolving skills and my passion for creating stylish online experiences in the world of web development. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and for the lessons it has taught me along the way.

Thank you for visiting [M.H. - Barber Shop](https://mh-barbershop.fr), and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
